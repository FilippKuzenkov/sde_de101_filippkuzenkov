6 Data Analyst Key Features (my opinion)
1. Collect and Organize Data  
   - Collaborate with stakeholders to define data needs (e.g., sales figures, customer behavior).  
   - Pull data from multiple internal and external sources such as databases, APIs, surveys, or spreadsheets.  
   - Clean and organize raw data by removing duplicates, correcting errors, and structuring it for further analysis.  

2. Explore and Analyze Data  
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in the data.  
   - Use descriptive statistics to summarize data (mean, median, standard deviation) and assess its distribution.  
   - Apply advanced techniques like regression analysis, clustering, and hypothesis testing to answer specific business questions.  

3. Visualize Data and Build Dashboards   
   - Create charts, graphs, and tables to visually represent trends and key metrics.  
   - Design interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).  
   - Tailor visualizations for specific audiences, such as executives or operational teams.  

4. Interpret and Report Insights  
   - Identify key takeaways from the data that align with business objectives (e.g., improved sales performance in a specific region).  
   - Write detailed reports or presentations explaining the analysis and its implications.  
   - Collaborate with teams to provide recommendations based on the analysis (e.g., adjusting marketing strategies or optimizing product offerings).  

5. Support Data-Driven Decision Making  

   - Run ad hoc analyses to answer specific questions posed by different departments.  
   - Provide data-driven recommendations to improve operational efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, or reduce costs.  
   - Analyze historical performance data to help forecast future trends and outcomes, supporting long-term planning.  

6. Ensure Data Quality and Accuracy  
   - Validate data to ensure there are no errors, missing values, or inconsistencies.  
   - Establish data governance practices to maintain data integrity (e.g., defining data entry standards or automating validation processes).  
   - Collaborate with data engineers to ensure the data pipeline is clean, and data from various sources is properly integrated.
